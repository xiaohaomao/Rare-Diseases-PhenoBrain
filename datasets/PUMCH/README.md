# PUMCH datasets





#### Four rare disease datasets are filed:  PUMCH-S.json, PUMCH-L.json, PUMCH-MDT.json, and PUMCH-ADM.json. Those files be fed into the PhenoBrain to calculate results. 



#### For convenience to present, we compiled those four datasets into a single excel file (PUMCH_dataset.xlsx). 





Those files were complied by Xiaohao Mao(Tsinghua University), Yu Huang(Tsinghua University & Tencent Jarvis lab) and Lun Wang(Peking Union Medical College Hospital) after removing patients' information, including a total of 1,149 rare disease cases spanning over 100s diseases.
